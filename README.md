# ICS2O-Final-Summative-Evaluation

Final Summative Evaluation (FSE) for ICS2O-01 (2018-2019)

By Gordon Lin and Daniel Weng

This was an evaluation of what we've learnt from the ICS2O class, using the programming language, Processing 3 (A spinoff of Java).

We worked on this for a month, feel free to download and try this game. We had no idea what we're doing, and we still have no idea what we're doing. We won't be updating anything, so any issues and bugs you encounter will not be fixed.

This was also our first time using GitHub for a project, so all our data may be a bit weird.
